# Be Better Budgeter

## Description
This project started out of a conversation with my wife where we talked about how we could be more on top of our finances, and after looking at other options out there they were a bit daunting. So what's less daunting then setting up an app, writing your own! I started on the endeavor and kept adding more as it evolved. I just wanted a way we could have a quick look at our budgets and our spend each week. Then we added more options, you can see a two-week period and a month period. Then we wanted to add in transaction tracking. Lastly, we decided to add shopping list functionality. 

## Technologies
This app is currently using [Render](https://render.com/) to host the front end and server, and uses [Mongo DB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) to host the database.

For this project I used the following items in the front end:
- JavaScript
- React
- Bootstrap
- Apollo
- JWT-decode
- Graphql
- Moment

For the back end I used the following technologies:
- NodeJS
- Apollo-server
- Express
- MongoDB
- Bcrypt
- Mongoose
- Jsonwebtoken

## Contributors
I did all the coding myself. My wife helped with design a bit and some functionality ideas. During deployment I had some issues and got some help from [Austin Wilcox](https://github.com/austinwilcox).

## Support
This project was intended for personal family use and learning. I do not intend to add additional users and increase app usage.

## Roadmap
I would like to eventually continue working on this application and add an integration with Plaid to allow connection with your bank accounts and live tracking of balance and spending. I also would like to add in the ability to track net worth.
